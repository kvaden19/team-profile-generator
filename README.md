  ## Installation
  Run "npm install" from the command line.
  <br><br>

  ## Usage
  Run "node index.js" from the command line.

You will see a series of Inquirer (command line) prompts. Simply follow the prompts to enter all necessary information about the team members.

Once you've entered the manager's information, you will see a menu to enter an engineer, enter an intern, or exit and render the HTML page. After entering either an engineer or an intern, you will see the menu again. This loop will continue until you decide to exit.

At that point an "output.html" file will become available in the "dist" subfolder.

The application does contain input validations for all fields.
